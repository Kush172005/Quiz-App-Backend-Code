      "1. Setup: Lie flat on a bench, feet firmly on the ground. \n2. Grip: Grab the bar with hands slightly wider than your shoulders. Squeeze the bar tightly.\n3. Un-rack: Take a deep breath, and press the bar straight up to un-rack it. Move it directly over your mid-chest.\n4. Lower: Slowly lower the bar to your chest, keeping your elbows angled down (about 45 degrees from your body).\n5. Press: When the bar lightly touches your chest, drive your feet into the floor and explosively push the bar straight back up until your arms are locked.",
    beginnerTips:
      "• Control the weight at all times; never let it freefall. \n• Keep your elbows tucked slightly towards your body (45-degree angle). \n• Press your shoulders down and back into the bench. \n• Take a deep breath at the top and hold it while lowering the bar.",

      "1. Setup: Place the bar across the top of your back muscles (traps), NOT your neck. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, toes pointed slightly out.\n2. Brace: Take a deep breath, and squeeze your stomach muscles (core) as hard as you can.\n3. Descend: Push your hips backward and bend your knees. Keep your chest high and your back straight.\n4. Depth: Go down until your hip crease is lower than the top of your knees (or as deep as you comfortably can).\n5. Ascend: Drive your heels into the floor and stand up explosively, squeezing your glutes (butt muscles) at the top.",
    beginnerTips:
      "• Focus on keeping your chest up and back straight. \n• Your knees should track in the same direction as your toes. \n• Start with just the empty bar or a lighter weight to perfect your form.",

      "1. Position: Stand with the bar over the middle of your feet.\n2. Grip: Bend down and grab the bar just outside your shins. Your shins should be touching the bar.\n3. Set Up: Drop your hips slightly, lift your chest, and pull the slack out of the bar. Your back should be completely flat.\n4. Lift: Drive through your heels. Keep your back angle the same as you stand up. Keep the bar touching your legs the entire time.\n5. Finish: Finish the lift by locking your knees and hips completely. Do NOT lean back. Reverse the motion slowly to put the bar down.",
    beginnerTips:
      "• Back is King: The number one rule is to keep your back perfectly flat and straight. Never round your back.\n• Hinge First: When lowering the bar, initiate the movement by pushing your hips back, not by bending your knees.\n• Control the Drop: Don't just drop the weight! Control it all the way down to maintain muscle tension.",

      "1. Setup: Hold the barbell at your upper chest, slightly wider than shoulder-width.\n2. Brace: Squeeze your glutes and abs tightly—this protects your lower back.\n3. Press: Push the bar straight up. As the bar passes your head, gently push your head forward (this keeps the bar over your center of gravity).\n4. Lockout: Lock your elbows out fully at the top, finishing with the bar directly over your ears.\n5. Lower: Lower the bar back down slowly and under control to the start position.",
    beginnerTips:
      "• No Arch: Avoid arching your back heavily. Use the glute/ab squeeze to keep your core stiff.\n• Full Extension: Don't stop short at the top. Get that full, strong arm lock-out.\n• Smooth Motion: Aim for a single, powerful, non-jerky movement from chest to overhead.",

Initiate: Pull your shoulder blades down and back. Then, start bending your elbows.\n4. Pull: Pull your body up until your chin is over the bar, focusing on leading with your chest.\n5. Descend: Lower yourself slowly and fully back to the dead hang position.",
    beginnerTips:
      "• Control is Key: Lowering yourself slowly is just as important as pulling up.\n• Avoid Kipping: Don't swing your legs or body to gain momentum. Focus on a strict pull.\n• Scaling: If you can't do a full pull-up yet, use resistance bands or negative reps (only focus on lowering slowly from the top).",

    beginnerTips:
      "• Elbows Locked: Keep your elbows pinned to your sides—they should not travel forward or back.\n• No Swing: Don't lean back to help lift the weight. If you have to swing, the weight is too heavy.\n• Feel the Muscle: Concentrate on flexing your bicep throughout the movement.",

    beginnerTips:

Only lift a few inches off the floor.\n4. Lower: Slowly inhale and lower your shoulders back down without resting your head completely.",
    beginnerTips:
      "• Hands Light: Do NOT pull your neck forward with your hands. The movement should come entirely from your stomach muscles.\n• Quality Over Quantity: 10 slow, perfect crunches are better than 50 fast, sloppy ones.\n• Chin Up: Keep a space between your chin and chest (like holding an orange) to protect your neck.",

Body Line: Extend your legs behind you so your body forms a straight line from your head to your heels.\n3. Engage: Squeeze your glutes, quadriceps, and abdominal muscles intensely.\n4. Hold: Keep this rigid, straight position for a set time (e.g., 30-60 seconds). Do not let your hips sag.",
    beginnerTips:
      "• Avoid Sagging: The biggest mistake is letting the hips drop. Squeeze your butt hard to keep your hips level.\n• Hands Position: You can clasp your hands together if it's more comfortable.\n• Breathing: Breathe deeply and steadily. Don't hold your breath while holding the position.",

Drive: Push through your heels and the balls of your feet to press the platform back up to the starting position.",
    beginnerTips:
      "• Knee Safety: NEVER lock your knees out straight at the top—always keep a small bend.\n• Back Contact: Keep your entire back, especially your lower back, pressed firmly into the seat.\n• Foot Position: Feet lower on the platform targets quads more; feet higher targets glutes and hamstrings more.",

Your pinkies should be slightly higher than your thumbs (like pouring water).\n4. Lower: Slowly lower the weights back down to the starting position. Control the weight, don't just drop it.",
    beginnerTips:
      "• Use LIGHT Weight: This exercise requires precision. If you're swinging your body, the weight is too heavy.\n• Shoulder Focus: Only raise the weight to shoulder height. Going higher uses other muscles.\n• Minimize Swing: Keep your body rigid and avoid swinging your torso to help lift the dumbbells.",

    beginnerTips:
      "• 90/90: Aim for two 90-degree bends (front knee and back knee).\n• Front Heel: Keep the heel of your front foot planted firmly on the ground the entire time.\n• Core Balance: Use a light weight or no weight at all initially to focus purely on balance and stability.",

    beginnerTips:
      "• Straight Line: Don't let your hips sag or pike up. Maintain a rigid plank posture.\n• Elbow Angle: Keep elbows tucked in, not flared out, to protect your shoulder joints.\n• Scaling: If standard push-ups are too difficult, place your hands on an elevated surface like a bench or box.",

    beginnerTips:
      "• Avoid Swinging: Avoid swinging your body back and forth (minimal lean is okay, but don't rock).\n• Pull with Back: Think of your arms as hooks—use your back muscles (lats) to pull the weight, not your biceps.\n• Chest Out: Keep your chest up and your shoulders down throughout the movement.",

Stretch: Slowly let your arms open back up, controlling the weight as you feel a deep stretch across your chest.",
    beginnerTips:
      "• Fixed Elbows: The angle of your elbows should not change throughout the set.\n• Mind-Muscle Connection: This exercise is all about feeling the chest squeeze. Don't worry about lifting heavy.\n• Smooth Arc: Ensure your hands travel in a smooth, continuous arcing path, not straight down.",

    beginnerTips:
      "• No Swing: If you start swinging, stop and rest.
